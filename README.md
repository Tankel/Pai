# Pai - A Virtual Pet (Programming Project)
## Description
This is a virtual pet called "Pai" (although you can put him the name you want). 
You're going to have to take care of him, you can feed him to increase his hunger bar
and send him to sleep to increase his energy bar. If you don't do it, he could die!.
In addition, you will be able to play rock paper scissors with him, but be careful, 
he is really good.
Warning: don't get attached to him, he will die between 60-80 years old.

## Clarifications 
You also need to download all the .txt files in order the program to work,
since ther work as sprtes, and if the program doesn't find them an error will be thrown.
