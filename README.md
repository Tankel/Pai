# Pai - A Virtual Pet (Programming Project)
## Description
This is a virtual pet called "Pai" (although you can give it any name you want).
In this project, you will take care of Pai by feeding him to increase his hunger bar
and sending him to sleep to increase his energy bar. If you neglect his needs, he could die!
You can also play rock, paper, and scissors with Pai, but be warned, he is really good at it.
Please note that Pai is not meant to be a permanent companion, as he will pass away between the ages of 60-80 years old.

## Implementation
This virtual pet runs in the console and is written in C++ using threads.

## Clarifications
To ensure that the program works properly, you must download all the .txt files as they serve as sprites. If the program cannot find them, an error will be thrown.
